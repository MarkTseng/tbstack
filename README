DESCRIPTION

tbstack -- fast stack trace utility.

A primary design goal is to minimize performance impact on a process to
make it possible to run it in low-latency systems. It is achieved by
copying contents of stack regions when the process is frozen and unwinding
stack when the process continues working. The idea was inspired by perf
tool.

The program uses POSIX, Linux API, and libunwind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPATIBILITY

This utility is intended for use with Linux on x86_64.

Libraries: libelf, libunwind. It is recommended to get the latest version of
libunwind.

INSTALLATION

In simple case you only need to run make:

    $ make
    # make install

Other options are available:

    $ make LIBUNWIND_DIR=/opt/libunwind BINDIR=/opt/tbstack/bin \
        NO_LIBUNWIND_PTRACE=1

    LIBUNWIND_DIR          libunwind installation prefix.
    BINDIR                 tbstack binary will be installed there.
    NO_LIBUNWIND_PTRACE    1 to disable support for libunwind-ptrace.

USAGE

usage:    tbstack <pid>

options:  --help               show help
          --ignore-deleted     try to open shared objects marked as deleted
          --proc-mem           prefer reading /proc/pid/mem (default on systems
                               with kernel older than 3.2. on modern kernels
                               default flavor is process_vm_readv)
          --ptrace             use libunwind-ptrace interface (slower)
          --show-rsp           show %rsp in second column
          --stack-size <size>  maximum stack size to copy (default is current
                               RLIMIT_STACK)
          --stop-timeout       timeout for waiting the process to freeze in
                               milliseconds. default value is 1000
          --verbose            verbose error messages.
